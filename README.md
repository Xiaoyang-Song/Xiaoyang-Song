Hi, I’m Xiaoyang Song. I am currently a Data Science M.S. student at Columbia University. Before coming to Columbia, I received my B.S. degree with double majors in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Michigan. During my undergraduate studies, I received rigorous training in computer science, mathematics, and statistics, and have worked with many distinguished faculties from University of Michigan on Machine Learning and Distributed Learning research. 

My goal is to research on the cutting‐edge theories and methodologies in the field of machine learning, statistics, and optimizations and apply them to Transportation, Biology, Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and other related fields in the industry. I am also interested in Federated Learning and Out‐of‐Distribution Learning, where we protect the privacy of ML target users and increase the robustness of ML models, respectively. Currently, I am seeking Fall 2023 Ph.D. position in the field of Computer Science (CS) and Industrial Engineering & Operations Research (IEOR).

If you are interested in contacting me, I can always be reach by email at xs2485@columbia.edu.
