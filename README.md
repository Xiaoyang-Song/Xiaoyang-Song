Hi there :wave:, I’m Xiaoyang Song. I am currently an Operation Research Ph.D. student at [**University of Michigan**](https://umich.edu/), [**Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering**](https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/). Before, I received my M.S. degree in Data Science from [**Columbia University**](https://www.columbia.edu/) and my B.S. degree with double majors in Mathematics and Computer Science from [**University of Michigan**](https://umich.edu/). During my previous studies, I received rigorous training in _computer science_, _mathematics_, and _statistics_, and was fortunate to work with many distinguished research faculties from the University of Michigan on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and Distributed Learning. 

As a passionate researcher, my goal is to explore the cutting‐edge theories and methodologies in the fields of _Machine Learning (ML)_, _Reinforcement Learning (RL)_, and _mathematics_ and apply them to Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Transportation, Biology, Manufacturing, and other related fields in the industry. I am also deeply interested in Federated/Distributed Learning and Out‐of‐Distribution Learning, where we made ML models more applicable by protecting the privacy of ML target users and increasing the robustness of ML models, respectively. In general, I am dedicated to deploying Machine Learning techniques into real-world applications in a robust and interpretable manner, hopefully with theoretical guarantees.

My CV can be found [**here**](https://github.com/Xiaoyang-Song/Xiaoyang-Song/blob/main/Xiaoyang%20Song%20CV.pdf). (Last Update: 12/2022)

If you are interested in contacting me, I can always be reached by email at xysong@umich.edu. <img align="right" src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Xiaoyang-Song&color=yellow">
